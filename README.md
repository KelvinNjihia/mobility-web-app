# Mobility Web App

I created this project with Angular. The reason why I chose Angular is because of mainly my familiarity with it. In addition, angular works well with leaflet js which is a great JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

## Installation


## On Remote Server
Navigate to the root folder, open terminal and run `npm install`.
Once npm installation is done,

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Now you can deploy dist contents on the server.

## Locally

To run the project locally:
first - navigate to root folder, open terminal and run `npm install`.
Secondly - run `ng serve`

Yay! thats all ðŸš€!

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

I will be available for any and all questions and clarifications you may need.
